# SelectSortk
Wrote a program called select-sort-k.cpp that modifies the selection sort algorithm to sort the first k smallest elements of the array with n elements (k <= n, the value of k will be entered by the user). The program read the integer numbers from an input file, store them in an array (dynamic), and displayed the k smallest elements in sorted order.
